# Perfect Numbers

#### Problem Description

Given an number **A**, return 1 when the number is a perfect number else return 0

**Perfect number** is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors

A **proper divisor** of a positive integer is the divisor that is strictly less than the number

#### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 10^6
```

#### Input Format

* Given an integer - **A**

#### Output Format

Return 1 if A is a perfect number else return 0

#### **Example Input & Output**

| Sr. No. | Input | Output |
| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1       | A = 4 | 0      |
| 2       | A = 6 | 1      |

#### Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

```
For A = 4, the sum of its proper divisors => 1 + 2 = 3; is not equal to 4
```

Explanation 2:

```
For A = 6, the sum of its proper divisors => 1 + 2 + 3; is equal to 6
```
